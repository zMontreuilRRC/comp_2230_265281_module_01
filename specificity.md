# CSS Specificity
CSS has to decide which rules to apply to an element when two rules are contractictory.

## Defaults
Explicit stylesheet rules always override default browser rules.

## Parents and Children
Children "inherit" CSS rules from their parents.
Child rules override parent rules.

## Ordering
Contradictory rules added to the same element with equal specificity will apply the LAST rule created.
